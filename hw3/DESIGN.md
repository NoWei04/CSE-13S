Homework 3 design doc:
For funciton 1 I plan to use a search algorithm to search a word for its suffix iteratively
I will likely draw this out on paper to avoid infinite loops or other problems.

For function 2 I plan on calculate the memory size required before storing allocating it

For function 3 I plan to use null pointers so memory does not get leaked

For funciton 4 I plan to use set up the dot product calculation similar to how a linked list works

For function 5 I plan to use impliment this iteratively and call the next pointer.

For function 6 I will likely refer to section b.11 for a guide on doing this.

For function 7 I will probably have to seek the textbook for this, because I have no idea how to approach it.
