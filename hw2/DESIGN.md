Next collatz number:
for this function I will determine if the given number is even or odd. based on that, I will compute the next number

Max element of an array
for this funciton I will use a pointer to traverse through the array. I will set the initial largest value to the first number, then compare the two values as i keep iterating.

Sum of positive elements of an array
For this function I will use the same method as the previous function, but instead I will evaluate if each number is positive, then I will add it to a sum if it is greater than zero.

Counting the negative numbers in an array. 
This function requires the same concept as the previous one, so I will use the but instead I will evaluate if a number is less than 0. If so, I will add to a coutner each time it is. 

For the calculator function my goal is to check if the first line is a number. I fso, then I will  check the next line for the type of oerator.  As long as there is no zero division, I will return the operation value.
