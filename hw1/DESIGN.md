## introduction

In this homework, I will do the thing and solve important computer science
problems and probably win a Turing Award for doing so.

TODO(you): write something sensible here.

Functions : 
For the disk function I will create the equation that calculates the area of the disk and return the formula

For the area of a ring function I will create the equation of a ring and by subtracting the smaller radius from the bigger ring.

For the bigger minus smaller function I will compare the two numbers and subtract the smaller from the larger.

For the values in range, I will input two parameters, then use comparison statements to see if it is within the bounds.

FOr the sum of greater squares, my function will take in inputs and compare their squares to see which one is bigger.
I will return the two larger squares.

## the caat program
Explanation goes here...

In the caat program I will iterate through the file and check if its a vowell. If it is I will print out the vowel twice and move on to the next charachter until I reach the end of file (eof)
